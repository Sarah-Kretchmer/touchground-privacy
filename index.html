  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how I handle information in connection with the TouchGround mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h2>The App is operated by:</h2>
  <address>
    Sarah Kretchmer<br />
    Rigaer Str. 13<br />
    10247 Berlin, Germany<br />
    Email: <a href="mailto:kretchmerberlin@gmail.com">kretchmerberlin@gmail.com</a>
  </address>

  <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>I do not collect, store, or share any personal data directly from users of TouchGround.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App does not require account registration.</li>
    <li>The App does not request or store names, email addresses, contact details, health data, or location data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App relies on third-party providers to function:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple App Store (for downloads, subscription management, and payments).</li>
    <li>OpenAI (for speech recognition and text/voice generation).</li>
    <li>Conversations with the chatbot are transmitted directly to OpenAI for processing. I do not access, store, or control this data myself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any data transmitted through these services is handled by the provider under their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a></li>
    <li>OpenAI: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do not control and am not responsible for how these providers process data. Depending on your location, data may be transferred outside the EU.</p>
  
 <h2>3. Anonymous Usage Analytics (TelemetryDeck)</h2>
  <p>The App uses TelemetryDeck, a privacy-focused analytics service, to collect anonymous usage events. This helps me understand which features are used and to improve functionality over time.</p>
  <p>This analytics data does <strong>not</strong> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>names or contact information</li>
    <li>conversation content</li>
    <li>precise location data</li>
    <li>health data</li>
    <li>or anything that directly identifies a person</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Telemetry signals may include general, non-personal details such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>which button was tapped</li>
    <li>which screen was opened</li>
    <li>which features are used most frequently</li>
    <li>generic device type (e.g., “iPhone”)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>TelemetryDeck does <strong>not</strong> receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your conversations</li>
    <li>names you choose for your coach</li>
    <li>or any user-generated text or voice content</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All analytics are anonymized and cannot be linked back to any individual.</p>
  <p>TelemetryDeck processes this anonymous data under their own privacy policy:<br />
    <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy</a>
  </p>
  <p>No user profiling, cross-app tracking, or device fingerprinting is performed. Analytics are used only to help improve the App.</p>

  <h2>4. Conversation Transcripts & Insights</h2>
  <p>When you use the AI Life Coach, your voice is transcribed into text for the purpose of generating a reply. These transcripts are also briefly analyzed to highlight key points you mentioned, which are displayed back to you in the <em>Insights</em> section of the App.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I do not store or access these transcripts myself.</li>
    <li>Transcription and analysis are handled by OpenAI as described above.</li>
    <li>Insights are generated only for your use within the App and are not shared with me or with other parties.</li>
    <li>Your conversations and insights are stored only on your device. If iCloud Backup is turned on, they may also be included in your device backups. Please note these backups only restore if you set up your iPhone again from an iCloud backup — they do not reappear if the app is deleted and reinstalled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Basis under GDPR</h2>
  <p>Because I do not process personal data myself, GDPR obligations are limited. If third-party services process your data, the legal basis is their legitimate interests or the performance of a contract.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights under GDPR</h2>
  <p>If personal data is processed by third-party providers, you may have the following rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, rectification, or deletion</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection to processing</li>
    <li>Data portability</li>
    <li>Right to lodge a complaint with your data protection authority</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6a. U.S. Privacy Rights (California)</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect, sell, or share any personal information as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).</p>
  <p>To exercise these rights, please contact the relevant provider directly.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 18, and I do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be published within the App.</p>
