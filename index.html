  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how I handle information in connection with the TouchGround mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h2>The App is operated by:</h2>
  <address>
    Sarah Kretchmer<br />
    Rigaer Str. 13<br />
    10247 Berlin, Germany<br />
    Email: <a href="mailto:kretchmerberlin@gmail.com">kretchmerberlin@gmail.com</a>
  </address>

  <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>I do not collect, store, or share any personal data directly from users of TouchGround.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App does not require account registration.</li>
    <li>The App does not request or store names, email addresses, contact details, health data, or location data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App relies on third-party providers to function:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple App Store (for downloads, subscription management, and payments).</li>
    <li>OpenAI (for speech recognition and text/voice generation).</li>
    <li>Conversations with the chatbot are transmitted directly to OpenAI for processing. I do not access, store, or control this data myself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any data transmitted through these services is handled by the provider under their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a></li>
    <li>OpenAI: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do not control and am not responsible for how these providers process data. Depending on your location, data may be transferred outside the EU.</p>

  <h2>3. Conversation Transcripts & Insights</h2>
  <p>When you use the AI Life Coach, your voice is transcribed into text for the purpose of generating a reply. These transcripts are also briefly analyzed to highlight key points you mentioned, which are displayed back to you in the <em>Insights</em> section of the App.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I do not store or access these transcripts myself.</li>
    <li>Transcription and analysis are handled by OpenAI as described above.</li>
    <li>Insights are generated only for your use within the App and are not shared with me or with other parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis under GDPR</h2>
  <p>Because I do not process personal data myself, GDPR obligations are limited. If third-party services process your data, the legal basis is their legitimate interests or the performance of a contract.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights under GDPR</h2>
  <p>If personal data is processed by third-party providers, you may have the following rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, rectification, or deletion</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection to processing</li>
    <li>Data portability</li>
    <li>Right to lodge a complaint with your data protection authority</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5a. U.S. Privacy Rights (California)</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect, sell, or share any personal information as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).</p>
  <p>To exercise these rights, please contact the relevant provider directly.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 18, and I do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be published within the App.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
